### Introduction 
This is a **portfolio website** HTML template built with a **minimal** design style to help freelancers create an engaging online presence for their skills, experience, and most loved projects. A minimal design concept has been used to make the website more appealing and attractive to the end customers. The light design style with gray backgrounds can highlight your content and keep the user engaged throughout the entire project browsing experience.


The key features of this template are : 
- 
* **Remarkable Performace** with **lightning speed**.
* They work **perfectly responsive** to all the screen sizes.
* This works **buttery smooth** on all major websites.
* Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **Vite**

## Installation
I've made this template using Vite js. It is a front-end tool that is present in npm. 
> Why did I use Vite? 
I've used [VITE](https://vitejs.dev/)  because of the speed it provides.

```bash
# clone the repository onto your local machine.
git clone "address of the repository"

# Go/Open the repository
cd vite

```
